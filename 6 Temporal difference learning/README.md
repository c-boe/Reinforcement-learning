# Chapter 6: Temporal difference learning

Implementation of Example 6.5 (Windy Gridworld) in section 6.4 and Example 6.6 (Cliffwalking) in Section 6.5 of Sutton and Barto's book [Reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html).


## Windy Gridworld

The [windy gridworld environment](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/6%20Temporal%20difference%20learning/gridworld.py) is solved by [Sarsa](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/6%20Temporal%20difference%20learning/SARSA_windy_gw.py).

## Cliff Walking

The [Cliff walking environment](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/6%20Temporal%20difference%20learning/gridworld.py) is solved with [Q-Learning](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/6%20Temporal%20difference%20learning/Q_learning_cliff.py).
