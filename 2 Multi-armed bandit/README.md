# Chapter 2: Multi-armed Bandits

Implementation algorithms from chapter 2 of Sutton and Barto's  [Reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html).

The multi-armed bandit environment (stationary and non-stationary) is implemented in [mabandit.py](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/2%20Multi-armed%20bandit/mabandit.py).
The simple bandit algorithm (section 2.4) and the gradient bandit algoritm (section 2.8) are implemented in [banditalg.py](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/2%20Multi-armed%20bandit/banditalg.py).
To test the algorithms and do experiments run [main.py](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/2%20Multi-armed%20bandit/main.py).
