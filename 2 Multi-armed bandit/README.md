# Chapter 2: Multi-armed Bandits

Implementation algorithms from chapter 2 of Sutton and Barto's  [Reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html).

The multi-armed bandit environment (stationary and non-stationary) is implemented in mabandit.py.

The "simple bandit algorithm" (section 2.4) and the gradient bandit algoritm (section 2.8) are implemented in bandit_algorithms.py.
