# Chapter 4: Dynamic Programming

Implementation of exercise 4.7 (Jack's Car Rental) in section 4.3 and exercise 4.9 (Gambler's Problem) in section 4.4  of Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html).


## Jack's Car Rental

The [Jack's car rental environment](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/4%20Dynamic%20programming/Jacks%20car%20rental/jackscarrental.py) is solved using [policy iteration](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/4%20Dynamic%20programming/Jacks%20car%20rental/policy_iteration.py).

## Gambler's Problem

The [Gambler's problem environment](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/4%20Dynamic%20programming/Gambler's%20Problem/gamblersproblem.py) is solved using [value iteration](https://github.com/c-boe/Reinforcement-learning/blob/main/4%20Dynamic%20programming/Gambler's%20Problem/value_iteration.py).
